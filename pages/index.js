			<h1>Mason Choi</h1>
			<p>Hi! My name is Mason Choi. I am a rising senior pursuing a dual degree in computer science and mathematics (with a concentration in statistics+data science) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I work as the lead software engineer at a finance AI company and cofounded an AI shopping startup. My interests range from machine learning and AI safety to scalable cloud infrastructure and data processing. I am a competitive fencer at the national level, and am an avid stock+option investor, 3d printer, climber, and fisherman ðŸŽ£.</p>
